# Role-Based Authentication & Authorization Backend (SaaS-ready)
Built a scalable backend system using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB implementing secure authentication and role-based authorization.  The system supports user registration and login, with passwords securely hashed using bcrypt and session management handled via JWT-based authentication.  Designed a clean MVC architecture with modular routes, controllers, and middleware to ensure maintainability and scalability.  Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) allowing different permissions for users and admins, along with centralized error handling and input validation.  Focused on backend best practices including secure API design, database schema optimization, and scalable authentication flow, making the project production-ready.
